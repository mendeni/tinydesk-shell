# Changelog

## 0.1.4 (2026-10-05)

* **`board save`** copies every setting that comes only from the firmware's
  built-in configuration into `/etc/board.conf` (the file's own lines and
  comments stay), so firmware built without them, such as an official
  release, keeps the board's pins. `board show` says when there are such
  settings. New `tdsh_board_unsaved()` and `tdsh_board_save_builtin()`.
* **Tab completion** skips directory entries whose names are too long for a
  shell path instead of copying them cut short (and the compiler no longer
  warns about it on Windows).
* **Long command lines:** a line longer than the terminal is wide wraps
  over several rows, and typing, Backspace, Delete, the arrows, Home/End
  and history redraw it correctly; before, the earlier rows were never
  cleared, so text was left behind or doubled, and the cursor could not
  move back across the wrap. Columns are counted in UTF-8 characters, not
  bytes. The width comes from the transport (`columns()` in
  `tdsh_terminal_io_t`: TIOCGWINSZ, the Windows console, the SSH pty,
  `tdsh_espidf_set_console_columns()`), else the terminal is asked once
  per line (`read_byte_timeout()`, ESC[6n), else 80.
* **Code style:** the C sources are formatted with `clang-format`
  (`.clang-format` in the repository root): braces on their own lines, one
  statement per line. Layout only; the code is unchanged.
* **Contributing:** a pre-commit hook (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`; set up with
  `pip install pre-commit` and `pre-commit install`) formats the C files of
  every commit with clang-format 16.0.6, the version CI checks with.
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` describes building, testing and formatting.

## 0.1.3 (2026-10-01)

* **nano follows the terminal's size** (asked with ESC[6n when it starts;
  80x24 without an answer, at most 80 columns). It assumed 80x24, so in a
  smaller terminal, such as a TinyDesk Terminal window, the status line
  (where Ctrl+C shows the cursor position) and the help lines were cut off.
  The help lines are clipped to the width. The Linux program's nano had
  the same layout and gets the same change.
* **The factory root password is named where it is needed:** `passwd`
  says the old password is `TinyDesk` while root still has it, and the `ssh`
  and `ftp` refusals name it (`TDSH_FACTORY_ROOT_PASSWORD` in
  `tdsh_espidf.h`).

## 0.1.2 (2026-09-28)

* **SD card at `/sd`** (`tdsh_sdcard.c`, command `sd`, root only): `sd
  mount | umount | format --yes | status` mounts a FAT card on the SPI bus
  (pins from the board configuration, shared with the W6100) in the VFS at
  `/sd`, and the shell's `/sd` maps to it, so the shell, `nano`, FTP and
  SFTP see it. `sd.automount = 1` mounts it at boot. `hwtest sd` tests on a
  mounted card instead of mounting it a second time. FAT long file names in
  UTF-8 are on in every ESP project (`sdkconfig.defaults`).
* **`ping -c <count>` on the boards** (1 to 100 requests per host, 4 by
  default), like the Windows and Linux programs; `ping -c` without a count
  shows the usage. The Linux program passes its default `-c 4` only when no
  `-c` is given.
* **`ping` output from a redirected session:** the replies and statistics
  were printed from ESP-IDF's ping task, so in TinyDesk's Terminal window
  only the first line appeared. The ping task now queues its lines and the
  session prints them.
* README: keep the checkout in a short folder on Windows (ESP-IDF's nested
  build folders pass the 260-character path limit).

## 0.1.1 (2026-09-28)

* **Windows program `tdsh.exe`** (`ports/windows`, `examples/windows`): the
  shell as a native Windows console program, for Windows Terminal. The line
  editor, history and Tab completion work as on Linux; `ifconfig`, `ping`,
  `date`, `cal`, `tz`, `write`, `hostpath`, `capabilities`. Its files are
  in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tdsh\rootfs`, the user is the Windows user name.
  `docs/WINDOWS_HOST.md` describes it.
* The Windows port moved here from TinyDesk, which now uses it for its
  Windows Terminal window; `tdsh_win_init_user()` sets the default user.
* Releases also contain `tinydesk-shell-windows-x64.zip`; the host workflow
  builds and tests on Windows (MinGW) too.
* The release text takes its version from `VERSION` (`{version}` in
  `RELEASE_NOTES.md`).

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-28): first release

### Releases and documentation

* Releases: a tag `v<VERSION>` builds the ESP32-C6 and ESP32 firmware and the
  Linux program and attaches them to a draft pre-release
  (`.github/workflows/release.yml`, packaged by `tools/make_release.py` with
  the same file names as TinyDesk's Shell edition). The README links the web
  installer.
* Documentation: `docs/SCRIPTING.md`, the reference for `.tdsh` scripts
  (running them, variables and quoting, `$(…)` and `$((…))`, conditions,
  loops, functions, pipes and redirection, limits, a tested example), and
  a Scripts section in the README.

### Name, licence, layout

* The project is **TinyDesk Shell** (`tdsh`): C prefix `tdsh_`, macros
  `TDSH_`, Kconfig `CONFIG_TDSH_*`, ESP-IDF component `tdsh`, headers
  `tdsh.h`, `tdsh_espidf.h`, ... Released under the MIT licence.
* Scripts use the extension `.tdsh` and the shebang `#!/bin/tdsh`; a
  directory runs its `main.tdsh`; `tdsh run <file.tdsh|directory>`.
* Per-user files: `~/.tdshrc.tdsh` (startup script), `~/.tdsh_history`,
  `~/.tdsh_tz`.
* `third_party/wolfssh/ide/` (project files for other IDEs) is not bundled:
  its paths were too long for a Windows checkout.

### Firmware and platforms

* The repository root builds the ESP32-C6 firmware; **`projects/esp32`**
  builds the classic ESP32 firmware (4 MB flash, PSRAM optional, 2.5 MB
  app + 1.4 MB `/fs`: the layout of TinyDesk's 4 MB ESP32 desktop, so a
  board can switch between the two and keep its files). Both share `main/main.c`, which registers an example
  command, `hello`.
* The ESP-IDF console can be a **UART** (`CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_UART`) as well
  as USB Serial/JTAG.
* Each firmware embeds its `board.conf` (not in git) or
  `board.example.conf` as the built-in board configuration
  (`cmake/board_conf.cmake`).
* Classic ESP32: libsmb2's `MD5Init`/`MD5Update`/`MD5Final` come from the
  ROM (`src/tdsh_md5_rom.c`).
* A board without Ethernet no longer logs "Ethernet start:
  ESP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED" every second.
* CI: `.github/workflows/firmware.yml` builds both firmwares.

### Board configuration (new)

* `tdsh_board.h` / `src/core/tdsh_board.c`: a portable `key = value` store
  for hardware settings. Built-in text (`tdsh_espidf_config_t.board_config`,
  embedded by the application) is overridden by `/fs/etc/board.conf`,
  loaded right after the file system and before any module that reads it.
  Test: `tests/test_board.c`.
* Command `board [show|get|set|unset|init]` (`set`, `unset`, `init`: root).
* Ethernet reads the `eth.*` keys; without `eth.chip = w6100` the board has
  no Ethernet and no pin is touched. `lan hw set` and `lan poll` write the
  keys. The Kconfig pin defaults are -1 (fallbacks only).
* `hwtest` reads `sd.*`, `rs485.1.*` and `rs485.2.*`; unconfigured tests
  print `[SKIP]`. Built for every chip (the LP UART test only on the
  ESP32-C6).

### Users and security

* Factory root password `TinyDesk`; nothing forces a change.
* SSH: a per-device ECDSA P-256 host key, generated on the first start and
  kept in NVS (`tdsh_ssh` / `hostkey`); `ssh hostkey [new]` shows or
  replaces it. The built-in development key is only a fallback, which
  `ssh status` flags.
* `ssh` and `ftp`: `status` for everyone; start/stop/restart for root, or
  any user on the local console.
* SFTP for every user; non-root users are confined to their home
  (`wolfssh_local/sftp_jail.c`, wolfSSH's file macros routed through
  `tdsh_sftp_allowed()`).
* Saved Wi-Fi networks have owners (database version 2; a version 1
  database is converted on first load, its networks becoming shared).
  Root's networks are shared; other users add their own.

### API for applications (ESP-IDF)

* `tdsh_espidf_run_console()` runs the local console loop in the calling
  task with its stdin/stdout (TinyDesk runs it in a desktop window);
  `tdsh_espidf_console_set_user()` / `tdsh_espidf_console_user()` switch
  the console's user.
* Structured Wi-Fi API: `tdsh_wifi_scan_list()`, `tdsh_wifi_save()`,
  `tdsh_wifi_forget()`, `tdsh_wifi_connect_saved()`,
  `tdsh_wifi_disconnect_now()`.
* `tdsh_time_auto()`, `tdsh_time_set_auto()` (automatic SNTP time on/off,
  NVS `ush_time`/`auto`), `tdsh_time_sync_now()`.
* `tdsh_ssh_is_running()` / `tdsh_ssh_set_running()`,
  `tdsh_ftp_is_running()` / `tdsh_ftp_set_running()`.
* Script worker tasks inherit the caller's stdio (background workers only
  from the local console) and hand the global streams back before exiting.

### Fixes

* `ssh stop` works: the listening socket gets a 0.5 s `SO_RCVTIMEO`, so
  `accept()` returns and sees the stop (before, the server task stayed
  until the next client and `ssh start` failed).
* The SFTP start directory is set for password logins too (FileZilla could
  not open `/`).
* A half-done W6100 setup is undone (`eth_setup_undo()`): without a chip,
  every network retry leaked a driver task and an SPI device.
* The 64 KB SSH heap arena is no longer a static buffer: it is allocated on
  the first `ssh start`, from PSRAM when the chip has it (the start check
  then asks for 64 KB of internal RAM instead of 96 KB), else from internal
  RAM (the check adds the arena's 64 KB). Boards without PSRAM keep 64 KB of
  static RAM for everything else; `ssh status` shows where the heap is.
* The startup-file template no longer mentions a USB Serial/JTAG console on
  every board.
